        <h1>
          Hi again, <br />
          my name is Polina
        </h1>

        <p>
          Around a year ago, I was relocated from Ukraine as a result of the
          war. This was a big shock to my life, but encouraged me to begin
          pursuing my passion for coding in the UK.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have since completed several IT courses which generally covered
          HTML, CSS, Javascript and React topics. This has helped me to build on
          my previous experience
          <!-- which has included me achieving a bachelor's
          degree in Economic Cybernetics and  -->

          working in client and tech support at a technology company.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m keen to continue learning and improving my skills and hope to
          become a front-end developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I understand that my knowledge and experience are limited even for a
          Junior position, but I was told that passion and hard work always pay
          off.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>
            I'm currently looking for new opportunities and would be open to any
            Apprenticeship roles or roles in which I could assist a Junior or
            Experienced Developer.
          </b>
          I'm located in Hampshire, Tadley and am happy to work remotely or to
          attend your office.
          <br />
          <br />
          Rest assured that as this is my passion I would make sure to do
          everything possible to be a good match and make an outstanding impact
          for your company whilst developing my own skills working with you.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Thank you for your attention!
          <br />
          Kind Regards,
          <br />Polina Chernii
        </p>
