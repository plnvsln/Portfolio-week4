      <h1>Hi again, my name is Polina</h1>

      <p>
        Around a year ago, I was relocated from Ukraine as a result of the war.
        This was a big shock to my life, but encouraged me to begin pursuing my
        passion for coding in the UK.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have since finished several IT courses which generally covered HTML,
        CSS, Javascript and React topics. Luckily my background, that consists
        of bachelor's degree in Economic Cybernetics and experience working in
        client and tech support at a technology company, helps me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m keen to continue learning and improving my skills and hope to become
        a front-end developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I understand that my knowledge and experience are limited even for a
        Junior position, but I was told that passion and hard work always pay
        off.
        <br />
        <b>
          Now im looking for new opportunities as like Apprenticeships or maybe
          Assistant for your Junior Developer.</b
        >
        Im located in Hampshire, Tadley, so ideally is to have a remote
        conditions, but i would be happy to come to office few times per week.
        <br />
        (smth abouth) would do everything possible to be a good match and make
        an outstanding impact for your company whilst developing my own skills
        working with you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for your attention!
        <br />
        Kind Regards, Polina Chernii
